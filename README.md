# KernelLogger
A lightweight background service that continuously records kernel logs (dmesg) and system logs (logcat) to your SD card, automatically refreshing every 48 hours to prevent storage bloat.

# Core Purpose
KernelLogger Module is a persistent, automated diagnostic tool that:

## Captures Critical Logs

Kernel logs (dmesg): Hardware/driver events, boot failures, kernel panics

System logs (logcat): App crashes, service errors, Android framework issues

## Saves to External Storage

Writes logs to SD card (/mnt/media_rw/[SD-CARD-ID]/LOGS/) for:

Offline debugging (no ADB needed)

Crash survival (logs persist through reboots)

## Self-Maintaining

Auto-rotates every 48 hours to prevent storage exhaustion

# Technical Value Proposition

## For Developers

Debug boot loops by reviewing kmsg.log post-crash

Identify hardware faults (e.g., touchscreen errors in kernel logs)

## For Kernel Testers & ROM Tester

Capture intermittent crashes during long stress tests

Share logs easily (pull SD card vs. ADB file transfers)

**For Power Users**

Monitor background system behavior without a PC

Detect SELinux denials or resource leaks
