# KernelLogger
A lightweight background service that continuously records kernel logs (dmesg) and system logs (logcat) to your SD card, automatically refreshing every 48 hours to prevent storage bloat.

# Core Purpose
KernelLogger Module is a persistent, automated diagnostic tool that:

**Captures Critical Logs**

1 :- Kernel logs (dmesg): Hardware/driver events, boot failures, kernel panics

2 :- System logs (logcat): App crashes, service errors, Android framework issues

**Saves to External Storage**

1 :- Writes logs to SD card (/mnt/media_rw/[SD-CARD-ID]/LOGS/) for:
Offline debugging (no ADB needed)

2 :- Crash survival (logs persist through reboots)

**Self-Maintaining**

1 :- Auto-rotates every 48 hours to prevent storage exhaustion

2 :- No manual cleanup required

# Technical Value Proposition

**For Developers**

1 :- Debug boot loops by reviewing kmsg.log post-crash

2 :- Identify hardware faults (e.g., touchscreen errors in kernel logs)

**For Kernel Testers & ROM Tester**

1 :- Capture intermittent crashes during long stress tests

2 :- Share logs easily (pull SD card vs. ADB file transfers)

**For Power Users**

1 :- Monitor background system behavior without a PC

2:- Detect SELinux denials or resource* leaks
