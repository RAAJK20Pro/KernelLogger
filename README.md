# KernelLogger
A lightweight background service that continuously records kernel logs (dmesg) and system logs (logcat) to your SD card, automatically refreshing every 48 hours to prevent storage bloat.

# Core Purpose
KernelLogger Module is a persistent, automated diagnostic tool that:

1• Captures Critical Logs

Kernel logs (dmesg): Hardware/driver events, boot failures, kernel panics

System logs (logcat): App crashes, service errors, Android framework issues

2• Saves to External Storage

Writes logs to SD card (/mnt/media_rw/[SD-CARD-ID]/LOGS/) for:

Offline debugging (no ADB needed)

Crash survival (logs persist through reboots)

3• Self-Maintaining

Auto-rotates every 48 hours to prevent storage exhaustion

# Technical Value Proposition

1• For Developers

Debug boot loops by reviewing kmsg.log post-crash

Identify hardware faults (e.g., touchscreen errors in kernel logs)

2• For Testers

Capture intermittent crashes during long stress tests

Share logs easily (pull SD card vs. ADB file transfers)

3• For Power Users

Monitor background system behavior without a PC

Detect SELinux denials or resource leaks
